          <h5>With our practice, you’ll be part of an intimate family practice consisting of around only 600 patients. With this solid foundation, the advantages are inevitable, and plentiful.</h5>

        <li>
          <h4>What is Direct Primary Care?</h4>
          <p>Direct primary care is a healthcare model focused on putting the patient first. That means treating them when they need it, never rushing patients through appointments, and being proactive with healthcare treatment plans. The doctor-patient relationship is just as the name suggests – direct. Direct primary care clinics don’t accept insurance, rather they choose to work directly with the patient, providing wholesale labs and prescription prices along the way.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4> Do you accept insurance?</h4>
          <p>Happily, no.  Insurance has inserted itself in the middle of what we consider the most important part of your healthcare, the relationship between you and your physician. Too many health care decisions are made based on what insurance dictates we can and cannot do for our patients.   We forgo insurance payments in order to save our patients from those arbitrary and intrusive decisions.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Will I still need insurance?</h4>
          <p>Yes. Direct Primary Care fulfills the Affordable Care Act requirement for insurance when paired with a supplemental wrap around policy such as a high deductible or catastrophic plan.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4> Can you help me find affordable insurance?</h4>
          <p>Absolutely.  We are fortunate to work with local benefits and insurance specialists who are able to build custom healthcare plans that are most appropriate for you.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Can I join if I have Medicare?</h4>
          <p>Yes.  You only need to sign a one-waiver declaring that neither you nor your doctor will directly bill Medicare for any of our services.  Medicare will still cover any laboratory testing, imaging, medications or hospitalizations prescribed by our office.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Is my membership tax deductible?</h4>
          <p>Unfortunately, not at this time.  Your retainer fee is not yet defined as a “medical expense” in most states and as such, is not deductible.   Medications or labs through our clinic may be reimbursed through an HSA plan.  We recommend discussing your specific circumstances with your tax specialist.</p>
